              Bachelor's in Interdisplinary Media Studies - University of
              California, Berkeley<br />
              Master's in Computer Science - Northeastern University (in
              progress)<br /><br />

              My untraditional journey to Computer Science started when I was
              eager to automate a repetitive task when working at Amazon. I
              started taking coding classes at night, fell in love with Computer
              Science, and decided to pursue a career in Computer Science.
              Shortly after, I left my full-time job at Amazon and interned at
              NASA working in Software Engineering for a planetary rover system.
              Having no prior knowledge of the system’s technologies, I quickly
              learned how to be comfortable with the uncomfortable which led me
              to finish the mission control display software ahead of
              schedule.<br /><br />

              This mentality of embracing the discomfort that comes with
              stepping outside your comfort zone has allowed me to succeed in
              different roles I’ve taken as a Computer Science graduate student
              such as organizing a COVID-19 Hackathon to help local non-profits,
              being a teaching assistant, spearheading a project in Mozillia’s
              Incubator Program, and more. My experiences have taught me that I
              am extremely passionate about the user-experience and am eager to
              apply and further cultivate my software engineering skills in
              full-stack positions.
